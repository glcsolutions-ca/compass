# NOTE-001: Core Capability - Consolidated Employee View

## Topic
Define the core capability of the system at a conceptual level.

## User Value
GLC employees who track time in multiple systems need one reliable place to view their time entries and assigned work packages.

## Must Be True
- The system provides each employee one consolidated view across approved source systems.
- The concept focuses on trusted read/consolidation behavior first.
- The view is employee-centered (time entries and assigned work packages).

## Out Of Scope
- Cross-system create/update/delete behavior.
- Technology stack, hosting, or implementation details.

## Open Questions
- Which fields are mandatory in the default consolidated employee view?
- Are there any role-based exceptions to the default employee view content?

## Candidate Requirement
The system shall provide each GLC employee a consolidated view of their time entries and assigned work packages across all approved source systems.
