# Temp Requirements Notes

This folder is a staging area for conceptual requirement notes.
Use it to capture one idea at a time before promoting to formal `REQ-###` files.

## Lifecycle
1. Pick exactly one concept for the session.
2. Capture raw decisions in one `NOTE-###` file.
3. Keep notes conceptual; avoid implementation choices unless explicitly requested.
4. Promote to one formal `REQ-###` only after the promotion checklist passes.
5. Leave unresolved decisions in `Open Questions`.

## File Convention
- Use `NOTE-###-short-topic.md`.
- Use `NOTE-000-template.md` as the starting point.
- Keep note IDs independent from `REQ-###` IDs.

## Promotion Rules
A note is ready to promote only when it has:
- clear actor,
- clear outcome,
- clear boundary,
- clear success condition,
- no hidden implementation commitments,
- unresolved decisions listed in `Open Questions`.
