# Brand Architecture

Purpose: define product naming and brand usage boundaries.

## Rules

- keep product names and package names consistent
- avoid ambiguous aliases in user-facing and developer-facing docs
- update brand references in one change set when renaming

## Source

- root README and app/package READMEs
