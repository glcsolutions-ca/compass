# Brand Architecture

## Brand Lockup

- Product platform: `Compass`
- Canonical lockup: `Compass by GLC`
- Legal entity usage (contracts/footer): `GLC Solutions, Inc.`

## Product Family Naming

- `Compass Hub`: central workspace for day-to-day operations.
- `Compass Timesheets`: time capture and time investment visibility.
- `Compass Chat`: AI chat interface for questions, information retrieval, and time-entry actions.
- `Compass Client Portal`: client-facing status and delivery visibility.

## Repository and Package Naming

- Root package name: `compass-platform`
- Internal workspace scope: `@compass/*`
- No compatibility aliases for legacy package scopes

## Copy Rules

- Use `Compass by GLC` in product-facing copy.
- Use concise module nouns in navigation and docs (`Hub`, `Timesheets`, `Chat`, `Client Portal`).
- Keep implementation language platform-neutral where possible to support future clients.
